# AUTOMATED-STUDENTS-REPORT-SHEET
This report sheet is designed to automatically calculate the test scores using 3D reference from all class (JSS1 to SSS2) of over 100 students. The total score for each student is automatically generated alongside the average score and the percentage. In the same vein, the grading system is also automated.
