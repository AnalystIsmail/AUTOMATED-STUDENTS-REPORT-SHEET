# AUTOMATED-STUDENTS-REPORT-SHEET
This report sheet is designed to automatically calculate the test scores using 3D reference from all class (JSS1 to SSS2) of over 100 students. The total score for each student is automatically generated alongside the average score and the percentage. In the same vein, the grading system is also automated. 
This reduced the stress on the school administration by getting the report sheet ready in three days, which contrasts with the two-week duration they use in preparing the report sheet.
This made the parents have increased trust in the school grading system, as a result of their increased trust and integrity in the school, more students (the school experienced about 25% increment of intake) resumed with the school in subsequent terms.
